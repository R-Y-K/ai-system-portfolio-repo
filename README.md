## Introduction

This repo contains the AI system that I used for the Ticorporate Demo Lab Project Valiant Attempt.
If you're not a programmer, and don't know how state machines work or how
Goal Oriented Action Pattern AI (GOAP) works in general this will likely go over your head.

Even I'm not sure if I can explain this in a coherent manner to another programmer, let alone to someone
who has no technical or system design expertise.

I'll try to go over how the AI works and try to explain it in detail with flowcharts and diagrams, that someone who would be interested
in hiring me would be able gauge my skills and whether I would be a good fit for the team or not.

# Disclaimer

Before we even start, I want to make it absolutely clear that I'll be completely focusing on the AI system
itself here,while leaving the components that are needed for the AI to work out.

There are many, many components that are needed for the AI to be able to function, which I will not be explaining in detail here,
because it would way too verbose, and again I want to focus on the AI system, rather than whole which makes it possible for the AI to function.

This AI is designed in a modular way, that this system is not inherently dependant
on those components themselves, but for the outputs that the assigned components should produce.
What this means is that if you want to use this AI, and want to write the your own custom systems that produce the required outputs yourself,
rather than using the ones I used for the Valiant Attempt, it should be possible to do so.

# About the AI system

Okay let's start.

Put Flowchart here.

As you can see, there are four layers for the main AI function loop.

1st Layer:
2nd Layer:
3rd Layer:
4th Layer:
